This collaboration occurs throughout the project.","Collaboration ensures that the following project benefits are realized:","1.\u0009The need for changes due to poorly clarified requirements is minimized. For example, during the Create Project Vision, Develop Epic(s), and Create Prioritized Product Backlog processes, the Product Owner collaborates with stakeholders to create the Project Vision, Epic(s), and Prioritized Product Backlog, respectively. This will ensure that there is clarity among Scrum Core Team members on the work that is required to complete the project. The Scrum Team collaborates continuously with the Product Owner and stakeholders through a transparent Prioritized Product Backlog to create the project deliverables. The processes Conduct Daily Standup, Groom Prioritized Product Backlog, and Retrospect Sprint provide scope to the Scrum Core Team members to discuss what has been done and collaborate on what needs to be done. Thus the number of Change Requests from the customer and rework is minimized.","2.\u0009Risks are identified and dealt with efficiently. For example, risks to the project are identified and assessed in the Develop Epic(s), Create Deliverables, and Conduct Daily Standup processes by the Scrum Core Team members. The Scrum meeting tools such as the Daily Standup Meeting, Sprint Planning Meeting, Prioritized Product Backlog Review Meeting, and so on provide opportunities to the team to not only identify and assess risks, but also to implement risk responses to high-priority risks.","3.\u0009True potential of the team is realized. For example, the Conduct Daily Standup process provides scope for the Scrum Team to collaborate and understand the strengths and weaknesses of its members. If a team member has missed a task deadline, the Scrum Team members align themselves collaboratively to complete the task and meet the targets agreed to for completing the Sprint.","4.\u0009Continuous improvement is ensured through lessons learned. For example, the Scrum Team uses the Retrospect Sprint process to identify what went well and what did not go well in the previous Sprint.

One of the most effective tools for delivering the greatest value in the shortest amount of time is prioritization.","Prioritization can be defined as determination of the order and separation of what must be done now, from what needs to be done later. The concept of prioritization is not new to project management. The traditional Waterfall model of project management proposes using multiple task prioritization tools. From the Project Manager’s point of view, prioritization is integral because certain tasks must be accomplished first to expedite the development process and achieve the project goals. Some of the traditional techniques of task prioritization include setting deadlines for delegated tasks and using prioritization matrices.","Scrum, however, uses Value-based Prioritization as one of the core principles that drives the structure and functionality of the entire Scrum framework—it helps projects benefit through adaptability and iterative development of the product or service. More significantly, Scrum aims at delivering a valuable product or service to the customer on an early and continuous basis.","Prioritization is done by the Product Owner when he or she prioritizes User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog. The Prioritized Product Backlog contains a list of all the requirements needed to bring the project to fruition.","Once the Product Owner has received the business requirements from the customer and written these down in the form of workable User Stories, he or she works with the customer and sponsor to understand which business requirements provide maximum business value. The Product Owner must understand what the customer wants and values in order to arrange the Prioritized Product Backlog Items (User Stories) by relative importance. Sometimes, a customer may mandate all User Stories to be of high priority. While this might be true, even a list of high-priority User Stories needs to be prioritized within the list itself. Prioritizing a backlog involves determining the criticality of each User Story. High-value requirements are identified and moved to the top of the Prioritized Product Backlog. The processes in which the principle of Value-based Prioritization is put into practice are Create Prioritized Product Backlog and Groom Prioritized Product Backlog.","Simultaneously, the Product Owner must work with the Scrum Team to understand the project risks and uncertainty as they may have negative consequences associated with them. This should be taken into account while prioritizing User Stories on a value-based approach (refer to the Risk chapter for more information). The Scrum Team also alerts the Product Owner of any dependencies that arise out of implementation. These dependencies must be taken into account during prioritization. Prioritization may be based on a subjective estimate of the projected business value or profitability, or it can be based on results and analysis of the market using tools including, but not limited to, customer interviews, surveys, and financial models and analytical techniques.","The Product Owner has to translate the inputs and needs of the project stakeholders to create the Prioritized Product Backlog. Hence, while prioritizing the User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog, the following three factors are considered:","1. Value","2. Risk or uncertainty","3. Dependencies","Thus prioritization results in deliverables that satisfies the requirements of the customer with the objective of delivering the maximum business value in the least amount of time."],"image":"../images/value_based.png"}}

To achieve this practically, Scrum believes in Iterative Development of Deliverables.","In most complex projects, the customer may not be able to define very concrete requirements or is not confident of what the end product may look like. The iterative model is more flexible in ensuring that any change requested by the customer can be included as part of the project. User Stories may have to be written constantly throughout the duration of the project. In the initial stages of writing, most User Stories are high-level functionalities. These User Stories are known as Epic(s). Epic(s) are usually too large for teams to complete in a single Sprint. Therefore, they are broken down into smaller User Stories.","Each complex aspect of the project is broken down through progressive elaboration during the Groom Prioritized Product Backlog process. The Create User Stories and the Estimate, Approve, and Commit User Stories processes are used to add new requirements to the Prioritized Product Backlog. The Product Owner’s task is to ensure increased ROI by focusing on value and its continuous delivery with each Sprint. The Product Owner should have a very good understanding of the project’s business justification and the value the project is supposed to deliver as he drafts the Prioritized Product Backlog and thereby decides what deliverables and hence values are delivered in each Sprint. Then the Create Tasks, Estimate Tasks, and Create Sprint Backlog processes produce the Sprint Backlog which the team uses to create the deliverables.","In each Sprint, the Create Deliverables process is used to develop the Sprint’s outputs. The Scrum Master has to ensure that the Scrum processes are followed and facilitates the team to work in the most productive manner possible. The Scrum Team self-organizes and aims to create the Sprint Deliverables from the User Stories in the Sprint Backlog. In large projects, various cross-functional teams work in parallel across Sprints, delivering potentially shippable solutions at the end of each Sprint. After the Sprint is complete, The Product Owner accepts or rejects the deliverables based on the Acceptance Criteria in the Demonstrate and Validate Sprint process.","As illustrated below, Scrum projects are completed in an iterative manner delivering value throughout the lifecycle of the project.","The benefit of iterative development is that it allows for course correction as all the people involved get better understanding of what needs to be delivered as part of the project and incorporate these learning in an iterative manner.

Therefore, Scrum encourages data-based, iterative decision making. In Scrum, the primary focus is on delivering products that satisfy customer requirements in small iterative shippable increments.","To deliver the greatest amount of value in the shortest amount of time, Scrum promotes prioritization and Time-boxing over fixing the scope, cost and schedule of a project.
